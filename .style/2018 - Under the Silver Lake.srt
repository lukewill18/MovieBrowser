23
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:16,471
I HAD THE FOLLOWING DREAM...

24
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:19,808
"Sunshine Through the Rain"

25
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:58,012
You can't go out today.

26
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,140
The sun is shining,
but it's raining.

27
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:04,018
Foxes hold their weddings
on days like this.

28
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,772
They hate it
if anybody watches.

29
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:11,192
Terrible things
will happen if you do.

30
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:27,568
You saw it, didn't you?

31
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:31,489
You saw something
you shouldn't have.

32
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:35,534
I can't have
such a child in my house.

33
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,665
An angry fox
came looking for you.

34
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,418
He left this.

35
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:06,357
You're to atone
by cutting your belly open.

36
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:12,113
Go quickly
and ask their forgiveness.

37
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,533
Give that back to them...

38
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:18,577
and beg for your life
on your knees!

39
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,836
They rarely forgive
even trivial things.

40
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:30,881
You must go prepared
to die for your sin!

41
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:34,218
Hurry now!

42
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,472
Until they forgive you,

43
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,225
I can't let you back in.

44
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:46,147
But I don't know
where their home is.

45
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:49,942
Of course you do.

46
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:55,156
On days like this
there's always a rainbow.

47
00:10:57,325 --> 00:11:00,995
Their home
is beneath the rainbow.

48
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:03,868
I HAD ANOTHER DREAM...

49
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,246
"The Peach Orchard"

50
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,279
- Take this, big sister.
- Thanks.

51
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,097
Weren't there six of you?

52
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,935
There were six of you before,
so I brought six servings.

53
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,438
You made a mistake.
Here, you have this one.

54
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,107
I already had mine.

55
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,401
That's strange.

56
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,322
I'm sure there were six.
Did someone leave?

57
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:24,990
No.

58
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:36,126
There really was another girl here.

59
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,921
Stop acting so strange!

60
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,549
Now leave us alone.

61
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,559
- She's there!
- Who?

62
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,232
- I don't know who she is.
- No one's there!

63
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,527
She was right there!

64
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,990
Have you got a fever again?

65
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:09,743
No!
Just tell me who she is.

66
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:11,829
Are you all right?

67
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,764
Wait!

68
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:35,686
Where are you going?
You're not supposed to go out!

69
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,826
<i>Little boy!</i>

70
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,086
We have something to tell you.

71
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,382
Listen carefully.

72
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:50,344
We're never going
to your house again.

73
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,472
Why not?

74
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,182
Your family...

75
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,768
cut down all the peach trees

76
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,145
in this orchard.

77
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,357
The Doll Festival
is also a seasonal festival.

78
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,861
It's the festival
of the peach trees.

79
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:11,782
We dolls are personifications
of the peach tree.

80
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:16,412
We're the spirit of the trees,
the life of the blossoms.

81
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:20,040
If you cut down the peach trees,

82
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,918
how can you hold a Doll Festival?

83
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:27,464
Those vanished trees
are weeping in their sorrow.

84
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,517
It's too late for tears!

85
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:41,395
Let us not blame the boy.

86
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:47,109
He wept for us
as we were being chopped down.

87
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,487
He even tried to stop them.

88
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:53,073
Because he'd get
no more peaches!

89
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,080
You're wrong!

90
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,583
I can buy peaches at the store!

91
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,253
But where can you buy
a whole orchard in bloom?

92
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,597
I loved this place

93
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,267
and the peach trees
that blossomed here.

94
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,313
I knew I would
never see them again!

95
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,732
That's why I cried!

96
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,124
Very well. We understand.

97
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:49,087
He is a good boy.

98
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,425
Let us allow him to see

99
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:58,305
this peach orchard in bloom
one last time.

100
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,558
I HAD ANOTHER DREAM...

101
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,895
"The Blizzard"

102
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:49,242
It's getting dark.

103
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:53,079
Is it night again already?

104
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:01,129
Don't be stupid!

105
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,676
It hasn't been that long
since we set out.

106
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,180
But we set out late.

107
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:13,308
We overslept.

108
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,477
That can't be.

109
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:29,365
It's only 11:00.

110
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,951
Your watch must be broken.

111
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:34,704
No.

112
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,081
The hands are moving.

113
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,463
The snow makes it seem dark.

114
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:47,675
It's turning into another blizzard!

115
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,597
Come on, let's hurry!

116
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:54,766
Are we on the right path?

117
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:16,245
Yes.

118
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:24,420
We'll be out of this gully soon.

119
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:28,841
We're almost
at the advance camp.

120
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:33,012
Enough!
I'm sick of hearing that!

121
00:33:34,764 --> 00:33:36,849
I've had it!

122
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,692
Get up!

123
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,820
Get up and walk!

124
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,199
You call yourselves mountaineers?

125
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:57,286
A little storm like this —
aren't you ashamed?

126
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,748
Little storm?

127
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,959
It's been three days!

128
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,380
It's never going to let up.

129
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,340
Nonsense!

130
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,634
It won't stop!

131
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:15,805
It's waiting for us to die!

132
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,267
All right.

133
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,897
We'll rest a bit.

134
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,574
Someone's coming!

135
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:42,081
It's true.

136
00:34:42,874 --> 00:34:44,667
Someone's coming!

137
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:00,057
No one's coming.

138
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,810
You're hallucinating.

139
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:09,192
Don't fall asleep!

140
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:12,069
You'll die if you fall asleep!

141
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:18,451
Get up!

142
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:20,286
Stay awake!

143
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,336
Get up!

144
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,048
You'll die if you sleep!

145
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,142
Wake up...

146
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,081
The snow is warm.

147
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,844
The ice is hot.

148
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:26,944
Wake up! Are you okay?

149
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:41,834
Wake up!

150
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:05,232
Wake up!

151
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:31,634
Wake up!

152
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:38,575
Look!

153
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:40,911
Our camp!

154
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:51,130
It's our camp!

155
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:59,156
I HAD ANOTHER DREAM...

156
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:02,451
"The Tunnel"

157
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:30,969
Private Noguchi!

158
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:37,309
Yes, sir!

159
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:39,436
You're —

160
00:49:39,728 --> 00:49:42,147
Sir, did I...

161
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:44,816
did I really die in action?

162
00:49:46,777 --> 00:49:48,278
I can't...

163
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:51,782
I can't believe I'm really dead.

164
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,452
I was discharged
and went home.

165
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:59,373
I ate the sweet rice cakes
my mom made for me.

166
00:49:59,665 --> 00:50:03,335
I remember it clearly.

167
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:11,176
You told me that once before.

168
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:17,849
You were shot, and you fainted.

169
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:23,021
As I tended to you,
you woke up and told me that story.

170
00:50:27,401 --> 00:50:29,194
It was just...

171
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:33,448
a dream you had
while unconscious.

172
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:40,372
It was such a vivid tale.
I couldn't forget it.

173
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:47,170
But five minutes later...

174
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:50,966
you really did die.

175
00:51:02,728 --> 00:51:04,521
Understood, sir!

176
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:09,276
But my mom and dad...

177
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:13,155
still don't believe I'm dead.

178
00:51:51,276 --> 00:51:53,111
That's my home.

179
00:51:57,824 --> 00:51:59,951
My mom and dad...

180
00:52:01,578 --> 00:52:05,832
are still waiting for me there.

181
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:31,691
But it's a fact.

182
00:52:32,484 --> 00:52:34,236
You were killed.

183
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:38,657
It breaks my heart...

184
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:41,326
but I have to be blunt:

185
00:52:44,037 --> 00:52:45,872
You died...

186
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:49,459
in my arms.

187
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,633
Noguchi!

188
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:50,348
Platoon...

189
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:52,809
halt!

190
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:59,024
Salute the company commander!

191
00:55:59,649 --> 00:56:01,151
Present...

192
00:56:01,985 --> 00:56:03,486
arms!

193
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,659
Order arms!

194
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,999
Third Platoon reporting, sir.

195
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:19,085
All present and accounted for.

196
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:34,893
Listen to me!

197
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:42,859
I understand...

198
00:56:45,195 --> 00:56:46,905
how you must feel.

199
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:52,243
Nevertheless...

200
00:56:53,078 --> 00:56:56,748
the Third Platoon
was completely wiped out.

201
00:57:00,794 --> 00:57:04,506
You were all killed in action.

202
00:57:10,512 --> 00:57:12,097
Forgive me.

203
00:57:21,106 --> 00:57:23,274
I managed to survive.

204
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:27,278
I can't even look you in the face.

205
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:35,537
The responsibility
for your deaths...

206
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:39,916
rests with me!

207
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:49,300
I could blame it all...

208
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:54,139
on the absurdity of war,

209
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:57,517
or the inhumanity of the military.

210
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:04,983
But to deny my own mistakes
and indecisiveness would be cowardly.

211
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:14,826
That said...

212
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:18,329
I was taken prisoner.

213
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:22,834
And life in that camp gave me...

214
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:26,838
a taste of the agonies of death.

215
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:30,049
And...

216
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:32,510
now...

217
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:37,307
as I look at you...

218
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:43,188
I taste that same bitterness again.

219
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:52,488
Compared to your own suffering,

220
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:54,991
mine must seem trivial.

221
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:02,790
But I tell you this honestly:

222
00:59:07,837 --> 00:59:09,380
I wished...

223
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:15,386
I had died with you.

224
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:25,939
Please believe me
when I say that.

225
00:59:32,487 --> 00:59:36,574
I understand your resentment.

226
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:38,868
I really do.

227
00:59:43,373 --> 00:59:45,416
To die in battle...

228
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,754
is to die like a dog!

229
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:57,595
But listen to me.

230
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,142
What good is it wandering
among the living like this?

231
01:00:07,522 --> 01:00:09,107
I beg you!

232
01:00:12,277 --> 01:00:13,861
Go back!

233
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:20,868
Go back and rest in peace.

234
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:45,351
Third Platoon...

235
01:00:47,312 --> 01:00:49,397
about...

236
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:51,566
face!

237
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:57,488
Forward...

238
01:00:58,948 --> 01:01:00,575
march!

239
01:03:12,582 --> 01:03:15,585
I HAD ANOTHER DREAM...

240
01:03:16,586 --> 01:03:18,963
"Crows"

241
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:22,753
Hello.

242
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:25,798
Do you know
where Mr. Van Gogh lives?

243
01:05:26,257 --> 01:05:30,011
If it's him you're after,
he crossed the bridge

244
01:05:30,136 --> 01:05:32,013
and went that way.

245
01:05:32,597 --> 01:05:34,140
Thank you.

246
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:40,438
Be careful, sir.

247
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:43,524
He just got out
of the lunatic asylum.

248
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:23,582
You're Vincent van Gogh,
aren't you?

249
01:13:29,907 --> 01:13:32,743
I HAD ANOTHER DREAM...

250
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:36,330
"Mount Fuji in Red"

251
01:13:38,332 --> 01:13:39,750
What's going on?

252
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:41,668
What's happening?

253
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,829
Has Fuji erupted?

254
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,623
This is terrible!

255
01:14:20,332 --> 01:14:22,292
It's worse than that!

256
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:24,628
Haven't you heard?

257
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:27,631
The nuclear power plant exploded!

258
01:14:28,507 --> 01:14:30,509
There are six reactors.

259
01:14:31,135 --> 01:14:34,429
They're exploding one after another.

260
01:15:05,002 --> 01:15:07,462
This is Japan.
There's nowhere to run.

261
01:15:07,629 --> 01:15:10,007
I know that.
We can't escape.

262
01:15:10,174 --> 01:15:13,927
But we have to try.
We have no choice!

263
01:16:19,451 --> 01:16:21,411
We can't go any farther.

264
01:16:22,371 --> 01:16:23,747
But...

265
01:16:24,915 --> 01:16:26,667
what happened?

266
01:16:27,251 --> 01:16:29,628
Where did all those people go?

267
01:16:30,212 --> 01:16:32,256
Where did they run to?

268
01:16:35,092 --> 01:16:37,511
They're at the bottom of the sea.

269
01:16:53,318 --> 01:16:57,281
Those are dolphins.
Even they're trying to escape.

270
01:16:58,198 --> 01:16:59,950
Lucky them.

271
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:02,619
They can swim away.

272
01:17:04,579 --> 01:17:06,623
It makes no difference.

273
01:17:07,124 --> 01:17:10,294
The radiation will get them
soon enough.

274
01:17:14,423 --> 01:17:16,133
Here it comes.

275
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:29,896
The red is plutonium-239.

276
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:35,152
One ten-millionth of a gram
will give you cancer.

277
01:17:38,822 --> 01:17:41,366
The yellow is strontium-90.

278
01:17:42,117 --> 01:17:44,661
It collects in your bone marrow

279
01:17:45,245 --> 01:17:47,748
and causes leukemia.

280
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:55,005
The purple is cesium-137.

281
01:17:55,756 --> 01:17:59,509
It accumulates in the gonads,
causing genetic mutations.

282
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:03,138
There's no telling
what you'll give birth to.

283
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:08,852
People are such fools!

284
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:13,690
Radiation was dangerous
because you couldn't see it,

285
01:18:13,815 --> 01:18:16,860
so they found a way to dye it.

286
01:18:18,362 --> 01:18:23,492
But that only confirms
you're going to die.

287
01:18:24,618 --> 01:18:27,204
It's just Death's calling card.

288
01:18:36,296 --> 01:18:38,131
Now, if you'll excuse me...

289
01:18:43,053 --> 01:18:45,305
Wait!

290
01:18:46,056 --> 01:18:49,184
Radiation doesn't kill you
right away, so maybe —

291
01:18:49,351 --> 01:18:53,230
Maybe nothing!
A slow death is even worse.

292
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:57,401
Death is one thing for adults
who've lived their lives.

293
01:18:57,567 --> 01:19:01,405
But children haven't even
begun to live yet.

294
01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:05,909
Waiting to die from
radiation poisoning isn't living.

295
01:19:06,076 --> 01:19:09,496
They told us,
"Nuclear energy is safe.

296
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:12,040
The danger lies in human error,

297
01:19:12,207 --> 01:19:14,584
not in nuclear energy itself.

298
01:19:14,918 --> 01:19:19,548
We won't allow any mistakes,
so don't worry."

299
01:19:19,965 --> 01:19:21,633
It's unforgivable!

300
01:19:21,925 --> 01:19:24,678
Those bastards better hang for this

301
01:19:24,845 --> 01:19:26,763
or I'll never die in peace!

302
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:30,642
Don't worry.
The radiation will see to that.

303
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:37,107
Please forgive me.

304
01:19:39,151 --> 01:19:42,946
I'm one of those who ought to hang.

305
01:21:09,366 --> 01:21:12,202
I HAD ANOTHER DREAM...

306
01:21:13,245 --> 01:21:15,956
"The Weeping Demon"

307
01:25:08,021 --> 01:25:10,023
You're human, eh?

308
01:25:21,284 --> 01:25:22,911
What's the matter?

309
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:44,808
Are you a demon?

310
01:25:51,022 --> 01:25:53,191
I suppose I am.

311
01:25:55,318 --> 01:26:00,114
But I used to be human.

312
01:26:03,034 --> 01:26:04,869
What a world!

313
01:26:06,162 --> 01:26:08,039
What stupidity!

314
01:26:34,148 --> 01:26:35,775
Long ago...

315
01:26:37,735 --> 01:26:41,865
this here was a field of flowers.

316
01:26:44,993 --> 01:26:46,494
But then...

317
01:26:48,162 --> 01:26:50,957
the hydrogen bombs
and missiles...

318
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:54,544
turned it into this desert!

319
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:03,928
But recently...

320
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:12,979
mysterious flowers
have begun to bloom...

321
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:18,902
in areas covered in fallout.

322
01:27:57,732 --> 01:28:00,318
These are all dandelions.

323
01:28:01,444 --> 01:28:02,946
Dandelions?

324
01:28:09,702 --> 01:28:12,080
Monster dandelions.

325
01:28:32,392 --> 01:28:34,310
This is a rose.

326
01:28:35,353 --> 01:28:39,107
But the stem grows
from the center of the flower

327
01:28:39,315 --> 01:28:42,318
and has another bud
growing from its tip.

328
01:28:48,324 --> 01:28:51,494
The radiation
scattered all around here...

329
01:28:53,371 --> 01:28:56,124
has left all these flowers...

330
01:28:57,834 --> 01:29:00,253
deformed and misshapen.

331
01:29:01,963 --> 01:29:04,799
But it's not just the flowers.

332
01:29:06,676 --> 01:29:08,761
Human beings too.

333
01:29:09,012 --> 01:29:10,888
Just look at me.

334
01:29:19,188 --> 01:29:21,357
Human beings are such idiots.

335
01:29:22,817 --> 01:29:27,196
We turned the Earth
into a dumping ground for toxic waste!

336
01:29:29,866 --> 01:29:32,285
There's no healthy nature left

337
01:29:32,744 --> 01:29:35,705
anywhere on the planet.

338
01:29:37,999 --> 01:29:41,127
No birds, no animals, no fish.

339
01:29:42,879 --> 01:29:44,672
Except...

340
01:29:45,173 --> 01:29:46,883
a while back...

341
01:29:48,342 --> 01:29:50,928
I saw a rabbit with two faces...

342
01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:53,389
a one-eyed bird...

343
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:57,018
and a fish covered in fur.

344
01:30:15,578 --> 01:30:18,372
What do you do for food?

345
01:30:21,501 --> 01:30:23,586
There is no food!

346
01:30:25,463 --> 01:30:27,673
We devour each other.

347
01:30:31,135 --> 01:30:33,596
The weak ones go first.

348
01:30:36,891 --> 01:30:39,143
My turn's coming soon.

349
01:30:43,064 --> 01:30:45,983
There's a class structure
even among demons.

350
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:49,445
Those like me

351
01:30:49,612 --> 01:30:51,614
with one horn...

352
01:30:53,116 --> 01:30:57,120
inevitably get eaten
by those with two or three.

353
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:03,960
Those who seized power
as human beings...

354
01:31:05,253 --> 01:31:07,713
the cunning and the shameless,

355
01:31:07,839 --> 01:31:10,424
rule the demon world as well.

356
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:24,397
Fine!
Let them have their way.

357
01:31:25,898 --> 01:31:28,651
Let them grow
all the horns they want.

358
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:32,071
Let them look
like terrifying freaks!

359
01:31:32,488 --> 01:31:34,574
Such are the torments of hell.

360
01:31:35,491 --> 01:31:37,493
It's worse than death.

361
01:31:37,827 --> 01:31:40,163
But they couldn't die

362
01:31:40,371 --> 01:31:42,456
even if they wanted to.

363
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:50,173
You see, it's a demon's karma

364
01:31:50,339 --> 01:31:52,341
never to die.

365
01:31:54,343 --> 01:31:57,471
They must suffer forever...

366
01:31:58,514 --> 01:32:01,350
tortured for their sins.

367
01:32:05,229 --> 01:32:08,608
But me, I'll be eaten soon.

368
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:13,196
No!

369
01:32:13,946 --> 01:32:15,865
I don't want to be eaten.

370
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:19,535
That's why
I'm running away like this.

371
01:32:21,829 --> 01:32:23,497
But...

372
01:32:25,041 --> 01:32:27,710
I get so hungry...

373
01:32:30,171 --> 01:32:33,007
and become disgusted
with myself.

374
01:32:36,385 --> 01:32:39,972
I was a farmer
when I was a man.

375
01:32:42,475 --> 01:32:47,647
I dumped tank trucks of milk
into the river to keep prices up.

376
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:54,403
Onions, potatoes, cabbage —
I bulldozed them all under.

377
01:32:55,863 --> 01:32:58,366
I was so stupid!

378
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:33,317
Hear that?

379
01:33:35,695 --> 01:33:37,697
When dusk comes...

380
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:42,285
those big-shot demons howl in pain.

381
01:33:44,787 --> 01:33:48,457
Their horns hurt
like cancerous tumors.

382
01:33:50,668 --> 01:33:54,255
Enough to make them yearn
for a quick death.

383
01:33:56,632 --> 01:33:59,343
But since they can't die...

384
01:34:00,219 --> 01:34:02,388
all they can do is howl.

385
01:34:09,145 --> 01:34:11,105
Come, I'll show you.

386
01:34:12,815 --> 01:34:14,984
I'll show you how they howl.

387
01:37:05,821 --> 01:37:08,991
My horn's beginning to hurt too.

388
01:37:14,955 --> 01:37:16,582
Go now!

389
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:21,128
Go where?

390
01:37:38,354 --> 01:37:41,524
You want to become a demon too?

391
01:38:38,872 --> 01:38:41,792
I HAD ANOTHER DREAM...

392
01:38:42,793 --> 01:38:45,254
"The Village of the Water Mills"

393
01:39:16,619 --> 01:39:18,495
Good day.

394
01:40:42,371 --> 01:40:43,706
Good day.

395
01:40:48,752 --> 01:40:50,796
Ah, good day.

396
01:40:52,214 --> 01:40:54,299
What's the name of this village?

397
01:40:55,634 --> 01:40:58,011
It doesn't have one.

398
01:40:58,971 --> 01:41:02,808
We just call it "the village."

399
01:41:03,892 --> 01:41:08,188
But outsiders call it
"the village of the water mills."

400
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:15,529
Do all the villagers
live around here?

401
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,322
No.

402
01:41:18,157 --> 01:41:21,326
We're spread all around.

403
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,082
You don't have electricity?

404
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:31,086
We don't need stuff like that.

405
01:41:32,588 --> 01:41:36,091
People are suckers for convenience.

406
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:40,596
They think,
"The more convenient, the better,"

407
01:41:41,096 --> 01:41:44,516
and they end up
throwing out what's truly good.

408
01:41:46,727 --> 01:41:48,896
What do you do for light?

409
01:41:51,565 --> 01:41:55,444
We have candles and rapeseed oil.

410
01:41:56,195 --> 01:41:58,363
Isn't it dark at night?

411
01:41:59,156 --> 01:42:01,784
Night is supposed to be dark.

412
01:42:02,785 --> 01:42:07,080
We'd be in trouble
if night were as bright as day.

413
01:42:08,373 --> 01:42:13,045
I don't want a night so bright
that I can't see the stars.

414
01:42:17,966 --> 01:42:20,219
You have rice paddies...

415
01:42:20,636 --> 01:42:24,264
but I see no tillers
or harvesting machines.

416
01:42:24,681 --> 01:42:27,017
We don't need such things.

417
01:42:28,227 --> 01:42:31,730
We have cows and horses.

418
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:36,109
What do you use for fuel?

419
01:42:38,237 --> 01:42:40,864
Firewood, mostly.

420
01:42:42,282 --> 01:42:45,661
We feel bad
chopping down living trees,

421
01:42:45,994 --> 01:42:48,664
but there are enough dead ones.

422
01:42:48,914 --> 01:42:52,709
We mainly just chop those
into firewood.

423
01:42:55,087 --> 01:42:59,341
And if you make charcoal
from the wood,

424
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:04,513
just a few trees give
as much heat as a whole forest.

425
01:43:06,223 --> 01:43:11,687
And cow dung
makes good fuel too.

426
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:40,883
As much as possible,

427
01:43:41,049 --> 01:43:43,343
we try to live

428
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:47,222
the natural way,
like people did in the past.

429
01:43:48,557 --> 01:43:50,517
These days...

430
01:43:50,893 --> 01:43:55,647
people have forgotten
they're a part of nature too.

431
01:43:57,816 --> 01:44:00,819
They can't live without nature,

432
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:04,531
yet they meddle with it
and destroy it.

433
01:44:05,115 --> 01:44:08,994
They always think
they can create something better.

434
01:44:11,038 --> 01:44:13,624
Especially scientists.

435
01:44:14,291 --> 01:44:17,085
They may be smart...

436
01:44:17,711 --> 01:44:20,631
but so many of them
are completely deaf

437
01:44:20,797 --> 01:44:23,467
to the beating of nature's heart.

438
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:30,098
They work so hard inventing
things that make people unhappy

439
01:44:30,724 --> 01:44:34,519
and then pat themselves
on the back for it.

440
01:44:36,605 --> 01:44:41,818
Even worse,
the vast majority of people

441
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:46,615
look at those idiotic inventions
as if they were miracles

442
01:44:46,907 --> 01:44:49,201
and bow down before them.

443
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:57,876
They don't notice
that nature is being lost

444
01:44:58,418 --> 01:45:02,714
and that they're heading
for extinction.

445
01:45:05,467 --> 01:45:09,721
The most important things
for human beings

446
01:45:10,138 --> 01:45:13,642
are clean air and clean water...

447
01:45:14,977 --> 01:45:18,730
and the trees and grass
that produce them.

448
01:45:18,981 --> 01:45:22,192
But folks pollute everything,

449
01:45:22,567 --> 01:45:24,653
and it's lost forever.

450
01:45:26,071 --> 01:45:29,157
The polluted air and water

451
01:45:29,449 --> 01:45:33,245
go on to pollute people's hearts.

452
01:45:53,181 --> 01:45:55,600
On my way here...

453
01:45:56,601 --> 01:46:01,356
I saw children
placing flowers on a stone.

454
01:46:01,815 --> 01:46:03,817
Why did they do that?

455
01:46:04,192 --> 01:46:06,236
Oh, that.

456
01:46:07,946 --> 01:46:11,742
I heard the story
from my late father.

457
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:15,287
A very long time ago...

458
01:46:15,579 --> 01:46:18,832
an ailing traveler

459
01:46:18,999 --> 01:46:21,418
fell dead on that spot.

460
01:46:22,753 --> 01:46:26,298
The villagers took pity

461
01:46:26,673 --> 01:46:29,092
and buried him
right where he died.

462
01:46:29,217 --> 01:46:32,804
They placed that rock there
as a kind of tombstone

463
01:46:32,929 --> 01:46:35,390
and offered flowers to it.

464
01:46:36,767 --> 01:46:41,104
It became a custom
that continues to this day.

465
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:45,984
It isn't just the children.

466
01:46:46,109 --> 01:46:48,111
All the villagers

467
01:46:48,236 --> 01:46:51,073
put flowers there as they pass...

468
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:55,577
without even knowing why
anymore.

469
01:47:08,924 --> 01:47:10,926
Is there a festival today?

470
01:47:15,097 --> 01:47:17,682
No, that's a funeral.

471
01:47:19,601 --> 01:47:22,562
You seem to find that odd.

472
01:47:23,146 --> 01:47:26,191
But a funeral is actually
a joyous occasion.

473
01:47:28,443 --> 01:47:31,947
It's good to live well
and work hard

474
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:35,450
and then be congratulated
on a job well done.

475
01:47:37,869 --> 01:47:41,414
We have no temple or priest,

476
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:44,459
so all the villagers gather

477
01:47:44,626 --> 01:47:47,462
and carry the deceased

478
01:47:47,754 --> 01:47:50,632
to the cemetery on the hill.

479
01:47:52,384 --> 01:47:57,264
Of course, it's different
if a child or young person dies.

480
01:47:57,514 --> 01:48:00,142
You can't really
call that auspicious.

481
01:48:01,810 --> 01:48:04,104
But fortunately...

482
01:48:04,229 --> 01:48:08,608
the people here lead
a natural way of life

483
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:13,488
and most die in the order
in which they were born.

484
01:48:14,948 --> 01:48:17,617
The lady being buried today

485
01:48:17,909 --> 01:48:21,746
died peacefully at the age of 99.

486
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:27,377
In fact, I must go now
and join the procession.

487
01:48:27,836 --> 01:48:29,713
Please excuse me.

488
01:48:36,553 --> 01:48:38,680
To tell you the truth,

489
01:48:38,805 --> 01:48:42,267
she was my first love.

490
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:47,063
But she broke my heart

491
01:48:47,314 --> 01:48:50,692
and married another guy.

492
01:49:26,394 --> 01:49:29,356
By the way, how old are you?

493
01:49:29,856 --> 01:49:31,274
Me?

494
01:49:32,025 --> 01:49:34,402
One hundred plus three.

495
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:39,157
A pretty good age
to leave the human race.

496
01:49:40,033 --> 01:49:45,205
Listen, people go on
about how hard life is,

497
01:49:45,455 --> 01:49:48,583
but that's just a lot of talk.

498
01:49:49,417 --> 01:49:52,754
Honestly, it's good to be alive.

499
01:49:53,129 --> 01:49:55,548
It's quite exciting.

500
01:59:33,209 --> 01:59:38,548
THE END
